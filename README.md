# AIWinpetition3_3_Youga

Our project:
During the COVID-19 pandemic, many counties have been forced to go into lockdown. Being health-conscious and all, many people have decided to do workouts at home.By using posenet from Tensorflow, our group has attempted a shot at "Youga", a yoga instructor application. We wanted to realise our vision by creating a React application and using real time pose estimation with Tensorflow.Js and Javascript. 

(Fun fact: Our application is named "Youga" because with this application, you can be your own yoga instructor. Combining "Yoga" and "You", we derived our unique name: Youga.)

Regardless of the initial results of this application, our group has tried our best at attempting this. Thank you for taking the time to read this. 


What we will be needing:
1. Install dependencies 
{a. react webcam
b. tensorflow js (for pose detection)
c. posenet model}
2. Import the dependencies 
3. Setup webcam and canvas 
4. Define references to those 
5. Load posenet 
6. Detect function 
7. Drawing utilities from tensorflow 
8. Draw functions 
- to draw on the canvas
